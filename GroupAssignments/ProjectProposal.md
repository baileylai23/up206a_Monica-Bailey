# Equitable Access to Safe Biking Infrastructure in LA

### Research Question
In our research, we plan to explore the relationship between neighborhood income and access to bike infrastructure, and how this impacts the number of bike collisions in the city of Los Angeles (LA). The research will compare neighborhood demographics from census data to existing bike infrastructure, and whether this correlates to traffic collisions involving bikes. By using this information, we can identify whether different socioeconomic factors contribute to communities receiving different levels of bike infrastructure. From there, we will also determine whether higher instances of bike collisions occur in lower-income communities.

### Why This Matters
Understanding how income affects bike infrastructure and the outcome this has on bike collisions is important to creating equitable bike conditions for all. By learning about how bike lanes can reduce bike collisions, we can prevent cyclists from incurring bodily harm or even death. Improving cycling conditions can encourage biking as a viable source of transportation, and have positive impacts in improving public health and the environment. In learning more about how socioeconomic disparities may impact bike infrastructure, we can find more equitable ways to distribute public investments in bike infrastructure amongst all communities.

### Spatial & Temporal Scope
We will look at income data from census tracts and existing bike infrastructure within the city of Los Angeles. We will also be looking at traffic collisions within the City of Los Angeles in the past eleven years, as the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) has a recording of all reported traffic incidents online from 2010 to 2021. The spatial and temporal aspects of this project matters because bike lanes are a recent addition to the cityscape of LA, so we want to see whether there are correlations between different neighborhoods’ access to biking facilities and the rate of collisions between bikers and other road users.

### Data Sources
We will be using the traffic collision data from 2010 to the present (January 2022) as documented by the LAPD.

We will also be using the the City of Los Angeles’s map of existing bike lanes, last updated in November 2021.

Lastly, we will be pulling US Census data for neighborhood demographics.

### Analysis & Visualizations
This project will analyze if there is a correlation between bike lane infrastructure and traffic collisions with bikes. Afterwards, the traffic collisions will be compared with neighborhood demographic data to analyze the level of bike infrastructure. The visualizations of the project may include a heat map or dot map of traffic collisions in Los Angeles and census tracts by income, superimposed on a map of existing bikeways in the city. Current graphs include bike collisions by type and bike collisions by victim descent. One possible idea for another chart to do would be to graph the frequency of bike collisions by census tract and order the tracts by MHI to determine if there's a correlation.

### Conclusion & Expectations
We want to better understand whether bike infrastructure is equitably distributed in neighborhoods of varying incomes in the city of LA. In turn, we want to find out whether ongoing improvements in bike infrastructure are correlated with a reduction in bike collisions. Inversely, we want to determine if areas with little to no bike infrastructure have a disproportionate amount of traffic collisions. By gaining insight in how bike infrastructure impacts bicycle crashes, we are contributing to creating safer conditions for cyclists on the road. In identifying these communities, we can use spatial data science to find ongoing inequities in biking safety across LA.
