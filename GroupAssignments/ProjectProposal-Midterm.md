# Equitable Access to Safe Biking Infrastructure in LA

### Research Question
Is there a correlation between neighborhood income, race, and access to bike infrastructure? If so, does this impacts the number of bike collisions in the city of Los Angeles (LA)? The research will compare neighborhood demographics of race and socioeconomics from US Census data with data of existing bike infrastructure from the City of LA. From this, we want o determine whether traffic collisions involving bikes correlate with specific neighborhoods based on community demographics and/or proliferation of bike infrastructure. By using this information, we can identify whether different socioeconomic factors contribute to communities receiving different levels of bike infrastructure. From there, we will also determine whether higher instances of bike collisions occur in lower-income communities and/or communities with different racial makeups.

### Why This Matters
Understanding how income affects bike infrastructure and the outcome this has on bike collisions is important to creating equitable bike conditions for all. By learning about whether bike lanes can reduce bike collisions, we can prevent traffic violence against bicyclists. Improving cycling conditions can encourage biking as a viable source of transportation, and have positive impacts in improving public health and the environment. In learning more about how socioeconomic disparities may impact bike infrastructure, we can find more equitable ways to distribute public investments in bike infrastructure amongst all communities. Compared to owning a motor vehicle, biking is an affordable and sustainable mode of transportation that encourages an active healthy lifestyle, which is why we should strive to make it accessible to all neighborhoods and communities.

### Spatial & Temporal Scope
We will look at income data from census tracts and existing bike infrastructure within the city of Los Angeles. We will also be looking at traffic collisions within the City of Los Angeles in the past eleven years, as the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) has a recording of all reported traffic incidents online from 2010 to 2021. The spatial and temporal aspects of this project matters because bike lanes are a recent addition to the cityscape of LA, so we want to see whether there are correlations between different neighborhoods’ access to biking facilities and the rate of collisions between bikers and other road users.

### Data Sources
We will be using the traffic collision data from 2010 to the present (January 2022) as documented by the LAPD.

We will also be using the the City of Los Angeles’s map of existing bike lanes, last updated in November 2021.

Lastly, we will be pulling US Census's 2019 American Community Survey data from Census Reporter for neighborhood demographics. In particular we will focus on the median household income (MHI) and race of each census tract in LA as proxies for a community's respective wealth and racial makeup.

- Source link for race: (https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B02001&geo_ids=16000US0644000&primary_geo_id=16000US0644000)

### Analysis & Visualizations
This project will analyze if there is a correlation between bike lane infrastructure and traffic collisions with bikes. Afterwards, the traffic collisions will be compared with neighborhood demographic data (racial makeup and median household income of each census tract) to determine if it correlates with the amount of bike infrastructure in the area. Current visualizations of the project include a dot map of traffic collisions in Los Angeles and census tracts by income and race, superimposed on a map of existing bikeways in the city. Possible visualizations for the future could be creating an isochrone heat map of specific bike collision hotspots around the city, identifying whether there are correlations with the surrounding streetscape or neighborhood demographics.

### Conclusion & Expectations
We want to better understand whether bike infrastructure is equitably distributed in neighborhoods of varying incomes in the city of LA. In turn, we want to find out whether ongoing improvements in bike infrastructure are correlated with a reduction in bike collisions. Inversely, we want to determine if areas with little to no bike infrastructure have a disproportionate amount of traffic collisions. By gaining insight in how bike infrastructure impacts bicycle crashes, we are contributing to creating safer conditions for cyclists on the road. In identifying these communities, we can use spatial data science to find ongoing inequities in biking safety across LA.
