# Equitable Access to Safe Biking Infrastructure in LA 

## Roles 

#### Bailey Lai: Bike Socio-Economic Investigator
- Looking into connection between socio-economics (median household income) and access to bike infrastructure and bike collisions
- Historical background of bike infrastructure in Los Angeles
- Creating maps for socio-economic variable
- Get bike lane map working (map coordinates are ‘linestring’ of multiple lat/long and not one single lat/long coordinate)

#### Monica Gonzalez: Bike Infastructure and Race Investigator 
- Looking into the connection between race and access to bike infrastructure and bike collisions 
- Historical background on bike culture in the U.S. 
- Creating maps for race variable 

## Status update
- General mood: optimistic
- Noticed a pattern of colors for certain LAPD bike collision codes, need further analysis
- Finding general trends in each variable (socioeconomic, race, bike lanes, bike collisions) and seeing if they correlate to other variables
- To do: get bike lane map loaded and plotted onto Jupyter

## Data Update
- Using the traffic data we obtained, we were able to stipulate specific data points for just bike collisions, and map these using python
- We also have found data for our race and socio-economic factors by using the census, and have mapped this 
- Our last step, is obtaining a data source for bike lanes in LA and mapping it

## Concerns

#### Major concerns
- Whether our product will be too similar to the other group also studying bike lanes in LA
#### Minor concerns
- Understanding the bike lane map (how to plot ‘linestring’ vs a single point)
Having too many data points from the LAPD traffic collision data, which shows all the reported accidents from 2010 to 2021
